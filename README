INSTRUCTIONS 

TexPlay version 0.2.0

To compile TexPlay, ensure you are in the directory with the Rakefile and type:
=> rake
OR
=> rake19  (assuming this is the name of your 1.9.1 version of rake)

!!NB!! be sure to run the version of rake that corresponds to the ruby version you wish to use! on my system I use rake19 for ruby 1.9.1!!

If all goes well, run the example programs:
=> cd examples
=> ruby example_melt.rb
=> ruby example_simple.rb
=> ..etc

*like any gosu application, gosu.so must be in the current directory (or the gosu gem installed) when running the examples.

Enjoy!
(note that TexPlay has only been tested on 32 bit linux systems and WindowsXP using VS 6.0)
