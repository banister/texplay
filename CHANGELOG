pixel out of bounds.
	
9/6/10
version 0.2.930
* not_a_color now returns true when color channel < 0

8/6/10
version 0.2.920

7/6/10
version 0.2.900

* :chroma_key now deprecated (by above functionality)
* using Gosu::MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE, hopefully fixes crashes on some linux
	distros
* Gosu::Color objects now accepted (and optionally returned by get_pixel)
* Monkey patched Gosu::Image.from_text() for auto-caching
* bitwise drawing modes no longer affect alpha
* rows and columns methods added to Gosu::Image, allowed Gosu::Image to be
	reopened by Gosu::Image.new (works with Gosu::Image#to_blob)


23/03/10
version 0.2.800
* added 28 drawing modes (using :mode option)
* added linear interpolation (:lerp)
* added 'trace' option to line for efficient pixel-based collision detection
	
12/03/10
version 0.2.721	
* fixed bug in alpha_blend (now blends alpha channels too)

6/12/09
version 0.2.710
* fixed bug in line drawing code (wasn't drawing final pixel)
* fixed bug in filled rect code (wasn't drawing final row)
* fixed bug in flood fill (wasn't drawing on first column)
* added glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D) calls to cache.c, and removed 'restore previous texture binding' (i doubt there is any previous binding to restore)
* using version.rb to help manage versions

23/11/09
* fixed bug in texplay.rb. Replaced TexPlay::TP_MAX_QUAD_SIZE - 2 with
just TexPlay::TP_MAX_QUAD_SIZE (the -2 is now built into the constant)

16/10/09
version 0.2.700
* removed memory leak from Gosu::Image#to_blob, now writing directly to RSTRING_PTR

12/10/09
version 0.2.666
* added Gosu::Image#to_blob
* to_blob functionality enables Gosu::Images to work with DevIL library

6/10/09
version 0.2.5
* fixed quad_draw flicker bug
* added splice_and_scale (to texplay-contrib.rb)
* now using rake-compiler to run build process

15/9/09
version 0.2.4
* added lsystem
* made lsystem both 1.9.1 and 1.8.6 compatible

11/9/09
version 0.2.3
* added Ruby 1.8.7 compatibility by modifying extconf.rb to define RUBY_19 macro
* and modified compat.h to get rid of feature test (fails on 1.8.7)

8/9/09
version 0.2.2
* fixed color_control bug, action_struct->color was being overwritten (now using a temp).
* fixed faulty error msg where max tex size was being displayed as 1024 but is actually 1022
* added :start_angle parameter to ngon action
* fixed example screen height from 769 to 768
* arity of -1 and 0 now supported for color_control procs
* fixed parameter checks for circle and ngon
* updated documentation to reflect changes, and added details on caching

2/9/09
version 0.2.1
* releasing a gem for TexPlay
* bumped version number so can add add gosu 0.7.14 dependency to github gem
* hopefully gem works on both github and rubyforge
31/8/09
version 0.2.0
* added each iterator
* added alternative to proc for :color_control proc (allowing static linear transforms to pixels)
* no longer segfaulting on windows (no idea why not)
* rewrote EmptyImageStub in ruby, using philomory's code. now alot faster.
* implemented 'shadow' in terms of static :color_control pixel transform
* added more example code demonstrating each iterator (example_each.rb) and new color_control behaviour
  i.e example_color_transform.rb
* should be relatively stable now! 

28/8/09
version 0.1.9.1 (still BETA)
* experimental features: Gosu::Image#dup and Gosu::Image#clone
* also TexPlay::create_blank_image(window, width, height)
* I noticed these features SEG FAULT on my setup in windows, so be warned
* This is a BETA release

14/8/09
version 0.1.9.0 (BETA)
* major rewrite. TP now supports beziers, polylines, polygons, and more
* also supports alpha_blending (though still tempermental)
* This is a BETA release

1/7/09
version 0.1.6.2
* fixed another subtle bug in constrain_local_boundaries(). Function was 
unable to deal with drawing actions that were 100% outside the image 
boundaries.

28/6/09
version 0.1.6
* gen_eval now working as a replacement for instance_eval in the #paint block. Allows for more user-friendly interface.
* #paint can now be called without a block; if invoked this way it executes any commands in the action queue, e.g
  @img.circle 20, 20, 40
  @img.pixel 30, 30
  @img.paint
* above will function as if: @img.paint { circle 20, 20, 40; pixel 30, 30 }
* collected 1.8.6/1.9.1 compatibility into compat.h

16/6/09
version 0.1.4.6
* allowed arity of 0 (as well as -1) for ruby 1.9 compatibility

13/6/09
version 0.1.4.5
* major bugfix with TexPlay#splice method (segfaut). Also added new color format parameter: color [1, 1, 0, 1] (e.g purple with full alpha).
Also fixed subtle edge-case bug in constrain_local_boundaries().

9/6/09
version 0.1.4
* improved error checking. should work better with later gosu releases

20/2/09 
version 0.1.1
* rerelease of this version fixing the oversized image bug for refresh_cache (i.e images over 500 x 500

version 0.1.1
* oops, bug in leftshift/rightshift functions, fixed!

version 0.1.0
* release!
