* and modified compat.h to get rid of feature test (fails on 1.8.7)

8/9/09
version 0.2.2
* fixed color_control bug, action_struct->color was being overwritten (now using a temp).
* fixed faulty error msg where max tex size was being displayed as 1024 but is actually 1022
* added :start_angle parameter to ngon action
* fixed example screen height from 769 to 768
* arity of -1 and 0 now supported for color_control procs
* fixed parameter checks for circle and ngon
* updated documentation to reflect changes, and added details on caching

2/9/09
version 0.2.1
* releasing a gem for TexPlay
* bumped version number so can add add gosu 0.7.14 dependency to github gem
* hopefully gem works on both github and rubyforge
31/8/09
version 0.2.0
* added each iterator
* added alternative to proc for :color_control proc (allowing static linear transforms to pixels)
* no longer segfaulting on windows (no idea why not)
* rewrote EmptyImageStub in ruby, using philomory's code. now alot faster.
* implemented 'shadow' in terms of static :color_control pixel transform
* added more example code demonstrating each iterator (example_each.rb) and new color_control behaviour
  i.e example_color_transform.rb
* should be relatively stable now! 

28/8/09
version 0.1.9.1 (still BETA)
* experimental features: Gosu::Image#dup and Gosu::Image#clone
* also TexPlay::create_blank_image(window, width, height)
* I noticed these features SEG FAULT on my setup in windows, so be warned
* This is a BETA release

14/8/09
version 0.1.9.0 (BETA)

* also supports alpha_blending (though still tempermental)
* This is a BETA release

1/7/09
version 0.1.6.2
* fixed another subtle bug in constrain_local_boundaries(). Function was 
unable to deal with drawing actions that were 100% outside the image 
boundaries.

28/6/09
version 0.1.6
* gen_eval now working as a replacement for instance_eval in the #paint block. Allows for more user-friendly interface.
* #paint can now be called without a block; if invoked this way it executes any commands in the action queue, e.g
  @img.circle 20, 20, 40
  @img.pixel 30, 30
  @img.paint
* above will function as if: @img.paint { circle 20, 20, 40; pixel 30, 30 }
